# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "A Low-power Single-ended Operational Amplifier using Sky130 PDK"      # Project title
  author:       "R. M. Lochana Mihisara Katugaha"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "A single-ended op-amp intended to function as a non-inverting unity-gain buffer."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Analog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"          # Valid values for analog projects: 1x2, 2x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 2        # Valid values: 0 to 6
  uses_3v3: false       # Set to true if your project uses 3.3V (VAPWR) in addition to 1.8V (VDPWR)

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_lochidev_two_stage_opamp"
